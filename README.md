# Forkify

#### Forkify is a web app that uses the food2fork api to gather recipes for different foods. The recipes contain ingredients which can then be saved to a list. Each ingredient can be separately adjusted or have the total serving size adjusted which will increase or decrease the ingredient list respectively.

Alt-H2 Setup
Have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) installed for the best user experience. Since live server comes installed with VS Code, running and instance of this app through the editor makes it super easy.

If you are not using VS Code, then you can install live server via npm or use any other way of running an instance of the app.
There are many stack overflow answers and other tutorials explaining how to do this. I will not get into that for this app.

Alt-H2 Directions
1. Clone or download the file from this repo.
2. In your command line interface, type 'npm start' to launch the app.
3. Type in any food that you would like into the top search bar.
4. Click on any of the recipes that you would like to see on the left.
5. Check out the recipe and adjust serving size accordingly.
6. Adjust each ingredient list on the saved list if you wish.
